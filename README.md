# Building Generative AI Apps & Agents with LangChain

This repository contains a series of notebooks developed for learning and implementing various functionalities of LangChain. The focus is on the integration and utilization of language models, prompt engineering, document retrieval, chain mechanisms, and deployment. Each module provides hands-on experience and practical applications in generative AI and LangChain.

## Modules

### Module 1: LangChain LLM Input/Output
- [01. Langchain Instruct and Chat Model OpenAI](https://github.com/AnkitaMungalpara/LangChain-AI/blob/main/01_Langchain_Instruct_and_Chat_Model_OpenAI.ipynb): Explores input and output handling with language models and chat models, including accessing commercial LLMs like ChatGPT as an Instruct LLM and Chat Model LLM.
  
- [02. Langchain Instruct and Chat Model HuggingFace](https://github.com/AnkitaMungalpara/LangChain-AI/blob/main/02_Langchain_Instruct_and_Chat_Model_HuggingFace.ipynb): Explores input and output handling with language models and chat models, including accessing Open LLMs via the HuggingFace Serverless API, using the HuggingFace Pipeline API for local LLMs, and utilizing HuggingFace as a Chat Model LLM.
  
- [03. ConversationPrompting with OpenAI and HuggingFace](https://github.com/AnkitaMungalpara/LangChain-AI/blob/main/03_ConversationPrompting_OpenAI_and_HuggingFace.ipynb): Explores techniques for prompting conversations using the ChatGPT model and open-source language models via the HuggingFace.
  
- [04. LangChain LLM Input Output Prompting with Prompt Templates](https://github.com/AnkitaMungalpara/LangChain-AI/blob/main/04_LangChain_LLM_Input_Output_Prompting_with_Prompt_Templates.ipynb): Discusses the use of prompt templates in prompt engineering to create efficient model interactions.
